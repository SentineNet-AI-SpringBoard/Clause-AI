Milestone 2 - Multi-Agent Coordination & Reasoning

Overview
Milestone 2 focuses on building coordinated domain-specific agents and enabling interaction between them. The goal is to move from independent clause extraction to collaborative, multi-agent reasoning using shared state and orchestration.

Key Objectives Achieved
    i. Defined coordinater logic for agents: Legal, Compliance, Finance, Operations

    ii. Implemented rule-based and conditional routing of queries to relevant agents

    iii. Built LangGraph-based agent orchestration for sequential and conditional execution

    iv. Introduced shared memory to persist agent outputs

    v. Enabled cross-agent validation and refinement

    vi. Designed structured output schemas for consistent agent responses


Core Components
    i. Coordinator Logic: Routes queries to appropriate agents based on intent
    ii. LangGraph Pipelines: Controls agent execution flow and shared state
    iii. Agent Memory: Stores intermediate outputs for reuse and refinement
    iv. Cross-Agent Reasoning: Allows agents to consider other agents’ findings before finalizing results
