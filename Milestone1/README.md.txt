Milestone 1: Cleaning Up and Getting to Know the Data
Hi! This is the first part of my project where I’m diving into the raw dataset to see what we’re actually working with. Before I can do any fancy modeling, I had to spend some time "doing the dishes"—cleaning the data and making sure it makes sense.

What I did in this step
The main goal here was to take the messy raw data and turn it into something usable. Here’s a quick breakdown of what happened:

Scrubbing the data: I looked for missing values and duplicates. I didn't want the same entry showing up twice or empty rows breaking my code later on.

Fixing weirdness: I noticed some inconsistent naming (like "N/A" vs "None") and fixed those so everything is standardized.

First Look (EDA): I ran some basic charts and stats to see the distributions. I wanted to see if there were any weird outliers that looked like typos rather than real data.

Some quick takeaways
The dataset is actually a bit smaller than I thought once the duplicates were gone.

There's a strong connection between [Variable A] and [Variable B], which I'll definitely explore more in the next milestone.
