WHEREAS, PPD is a clinical research organization engaged in the business of managing clinical research programs and providing services regarding the development of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, biotechnology and other products through clinical testing; WHEREAS, VS is in the business of providing imaging services to the medical, pharmaceutical and related industries; WHEREAS, PPD and VS desire to enter into a mutually beneficial relationship with a mission to deliver a comprehensive set of clinical and medical imaging services that will enable biopharmaceutical companies to make faster, more confident decisions on the development of their compounds, creating time and cost efficiencies; and WHEREAS, the parties desire to develop, market, sell, and deliver those joint service offerings pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein",

Term. The term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of two (2) years (\"Initial Term\") unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 11 of this Agreement. Upon expiration of the Initial Term, unless written notice to the contrary is provided by one party to the other party at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term, this Agreement shall be renewed for additional, successive periods of one (1) year each (each a \"Renewal\" and together with the Initial Term, collectively, the \"Term\")",
    ". In connection with any Renewal, the parties shall mutually agree upon and set forth in a written amendment signed by the parties (i) any changes to the Services constituting Preferred Services and (ii) any changes to the [***], VS Preferred Pricing, percentage Discount (defined in Section 4 below) or Bookings thresholds for all such Preferred Services. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, all active Work Orders issued prior to such expiration or termination shall remain subject to the terms and conditions contained herein so long as such Work Order remains active. 2. Services. PPD or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates may engage VS to perform imaging services (the \"Services\") for a specific sponsor's clinical research study (\"Sponsor\") or for a particular project. The Services may be amended, supplemented, or replaced from time to time upon mutual agreement of VS and PPD.",
    "1",
    "3. Services Commitment. \"Preferred Services\" shall be defined as those imaging services included within the service offerings of VS at the time of final execution of this Agreement which are specifically provided by VS in the therapeutic areas of hematology and oncology (\"Designated Therapeutic Areas\") to the extent such imaging services are subject to the commitments of VS set forth in this Section 3 (the \"Commitments\"). \"PPD Services\" shall be defined as clinical research organization services regarding the management of clinical trials for the development of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, biotechnology and other products through clinical testing. Preferred Services and PPD Services shall be subject to all of the rights and obligations otherwise set forth in this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit the provision of non-Preferred Services hereunder, however, such non-Preferred Services shall not be subject to the Commitments set forth in this Section 3. a",
    ". a. Joint Commitments (i) The parties acknowledge and agree that it is their intent and commitment to expand the Joint Solution (as defined below) to therapeutic areas beyond the Designated Therapeutic Areas. Upon mutual agreement regarding such expansion, it is the parties' further intent to make such additional Joint Solution services subject to substantially the same commitments as those set forth herein. (ii) The parties acknowledge and agree that each party has in place, or will develop, processes and procedures applicable to their performance hereunder as specified on Exhibit A (\"Integration Services\"). The Integration Services shall be reviewed and assessed by the parties from time to time and may be amended or updated from time to time. Exhibit A shall be used as a guide for developing integrated service offerings to meet the needs of each party's clients, as applicable (in each instance, a \"Joint Solution\" or collectively, the \"Joint Solution\")",
    ". (iii) Where either party determines that an opportunity exists and is appropriate for the offering of the Joint Solution to that party's customer or client, it is the parties' mutual intent and commitment to collaborate, as needed, to propose the Joint Solution to that customer or client. Each party agrees to make a good faith effort to promote a Joint Solution for a Sponsor seeking services that could reasonably be addressed by the Joint Solution. In connection with PPD's response to a request for proposal (an \"RFP\") in which a Joint Solution is proposed, PPD shall be responsible for the preparation and submission of such RFP response; provided, however, that PPD shall provide VS an opportunity to review and provide approval on the Joint Solution framework, including, the scope of the Preferred Services and the pricing thereof. VS shall provide such review within two (2) business days following receipt by VS of such RFP response from PPD",
    ". VS shall provide such review within two (2) business days following receipt by VS of such RFP response from PPD. Where reasonably appropriate for the proper defense of an RFP, PPD will use its reasonable efforts to provide VS an opportunity to participate in a call or bid defense meeting to the extent related to the Joint Solution. In the event PPD is awarded a clinical research study and such award includes selection by Sponsor of the Joint Solution, the parties shall mutually agree upon an applicable Work Order in accordance with Section 4 below.",
    "2",
    "A. However, nothing contained herein shall be construed to impose upon PPD an obligation to offer the Joint Solution or to use VS for Preferred Services where: (1) Sponsor is not in agreement, (2) VS's pricing is not competitive, or (3) there have been advances in technology not offered by VS. B. Further, nothing contained herein shall enable either party to utilize the Joint Solution where the client has rejected the involvement of either party. For the avoidance of doubt, the Joint Solution shall only be utilized where both parties' services in furtherance of the Joint Solution have been retained by the client. Nonetheless, a client's selection or rejection of either party for services outside the Joint Solution shall in no way impact or impede a party from performing such services, regardless of the other party's selection or rejection by the client. C",
    ". C. In the event either party discovers, directly or indirectly, technology not currently in use by the other party but which could improve the Preferred Services, PPD Services or the Joint Solution, the discovering party may elect to share such technology with the other party with the intent of integration by the other party. However, to the extent such other party elects not to integrate or otherwise use such technology, the discovering party shall not be prohibited from using that technology without the other party's involvement. (iv) During the Term, VS acknowledges and agrees that, to the extent it is aware of an opportunity for clinical research services, it will refer such opportunity to PPD as soon as possible. VS shall not refer that opportunity to any other third party provider unless PPD declines to bid on such opportunity or does not offer the service in question",

    "3",
    "(v) During the Term of this Agreement, except as otherwise permitted by this Section 3(a)(v), VS agrees that it shall not enter into the same or substantially similar Commitments with any other company or entity which performs clinical research services the same or similar to those provided by PPD or any PPD affiliate (collectively, \"PPD Competitor\"), nor shall VS provide preferred pricing to a PPD Competitor which is better than that provided by VS hereunder to PPD.

    ". In the event that, during the Term of this Agreement, VS desires to enter into the same or substantially similar Commitments with a PPD Competitor for imaging services outside of the Designated Therapeutic Areas (defined herein or in any amendment hereto), VS shall first notify PPD regarding the same and PPD shall have a right, for a period of 45 days following receipt of such notice (the \"Election Period\"), to elect to include such imaging services as \"Preferred Services\" hereunder (the \"Right of First Refusal\"). In the event PPD either (i) fails to respond within the Election Period or (ii) declines to include such imaging services as \"Preferred Services\" prior to termination of the Election Period, then in either such event, VS shall be permitted to pursue such relationship without being considered in violation of the Commitments or this Agreement",
    ". Additionally, in the event that PPD enters into a relationship with a VS competitor which provides for commitments which are the same or substantially similar to the Commitments in a therapeutic area outside the Designated Therapeutic Areas (defined herein or in any amendment hereto), VS shall have the right, without violating the Commitments or this Agreement (including the Right of First Refusal), to enter into a relationship with a PPD Competitor which provides for commitments which are the same or substantially similar to the Commitments outside the Designated Therapeutic Areas (defined herein or in any amendment hereto). (vi) The parties shall form a Steering Committee comprised of high level personnel from each party which shall meet quarterly during the Term of this Agreement to oversee the implementation of this preferred relationship and the obligations set forth herein. The Steering Committee shall be comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party",
    ". The Steering Committee shall be comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party. PPD's Steering Committee representatives shall be comprised of: Director, Finance; Therapeutic Head; Relationship Manager; Executive Director, Business Development; Executive Director, Information Technology; Medical Director, Global Drug Development. VS's Steering Committee representatives shall be comprised of: Chief Financial Officer; Chief Executive Officer/President; Director of Operations and Director of Project Management.

Each party's Steering Committee representatives shall hold a position of sufficient level within its respective company to be able to obtain timely resolution of disputes submitted to the Steering Committee.",
    "4",
    "In the event a Sponsor shall raise concerns or issues with respect to any Preferred Services performed by VS in conjunction with Sponsor's selection of the Joint Solution, which Preferred Services are agreed upon by the parties in an executed Work Order, VS and PPD shall mutually evaluate such concerns or issues prior to any communication with Sponsor and shall mutually agree upon an appropriate response to Sponsor related to such concerns or issues. The resolution of any such matters shall be submitted first to the parties' respective Project Manager for the study, and in the event such persons are unable to agree upon resolution, then to each parties' Relationship Manager/Senior Director and finally to the Therapeutic Head or equivalent position. The foregoing paragraph shall not be deemed to restrict a PPD project manager from ordinary course discussions with a Sponsor in order to collect information related to the nature of any such concerns or issues raised by Sponsor. b",
    ". b. VS Commitment. VS agrees to continue to make investments in and improvements to those processes, technologies, techniques, software, hardware and methods which are integral or beneficial to the Services provided by VS, specifically but without limitation, to the Preferred Services. c. PPD Commitment. Where PPD is in a position to make a recommendation to Sponsor with regard to imaging services, and VS is able to provide such imaging services in accordance with Sponsor's specifications, PPD agrees to recommend VS to Sponsor. PPD also agrees to maintain, when present, VS's name and logo on all VS generated deliverables to the Sponsor. 4. Compensation. a",

The parties acknowledge that no services shall be conducted by VS and no compensation shall be due and payable to VS without a Work Order.

VS shall be compensated for the Services in accordance with the Work Order. All pricing and rates used to establish the budget for Services set forth in each Work Order shall be in accordance with the pricing structures agreed upon by the parties herein and set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
