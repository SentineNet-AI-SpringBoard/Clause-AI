CERES and IGER aim to develop commercial biomass crops from leading Miscanthus lines via a collaboration with 2 major foci: I) propagation; and II) breeding. These are described in turn below.\nI. Propagation.",
    "I. Propagation.\nThe major barrier to profitable Miscanthus cropping is efficient and inexpensive propagation. In the UK, subsidy support makes [***] of Miscanthus x giganteus an economically viable planting method. This is not the case in [***], where there is no government support for the crop and initial [***] from which to generate planting material is extremely limited.\nIt is not commercially feasible to produce Miscanthus on a large scale in [***] from traditional [***] schemes. Success of Miscanthus crops for large markets will be determined by development of\n[SECTION] CERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1\n BETWEEN CERES, INC.

    "All other lines of crop development research in this collaboration will be dependent on success with propagation.\nTo be successful, Miscanthus must be planted from small, homogenous propagules that can be cheaply and rapidly produced, flow-ably transported, stored for months and consistently emerge after planting. In theory, the best propagule for Miscanthus production is seed. However, propagation of Miscanthus from seed is complicated and difficult. Development of [***] Miscanthus varieties will be a [***] of the [***] of this collaboration.\nAn alternative approach to seed in the short term is to [***] Miscanthus from [***] as is common in [***]. [***] is more feasible with decreasing [***] and has not been thoroughly explored in Europe. The potential of [***] should be investigated from both an applied and basic perspective.
