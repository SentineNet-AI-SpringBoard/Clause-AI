This folder contains rule-based coordinator outputs for multi-agent contract analysis.

Files:
- conditional_routing.json : Query-to-agent routing decisions
- coordinator_output.json : Raw coordinator execution metadata
- coordinator_newword.json : Validation of new keyword routing (indemnity)
- coordinator_merged_output.json : Final merged agent analysis
- coordinator_execution_summary_report.txt : Human-readable execution summary

The coordinator uses deterministic keyword-based routing to ensure explainability,
auditability, and enterprise-grade reliability.
