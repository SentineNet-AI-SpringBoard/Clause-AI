#  CLAUSEAI

### AI Tool to Read and Analyze Legal Contracts Automatically

---

##  Project Overview

ClauseAI is an AI-powered system designed to **automate legal contract analysis**, improving efficiency and precision while generating customized, actionable reports.
It leverages a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline combined with a **multi-agent architecture**, where each AI agent specializes in a distinct contract domain such as **Legal, Compliance, Finance, and Operations**.

This project implements an end-to-end pipeline to:

* Read contract documents
* Retrieve relevant clauses using semantic search
* Analyze risks using specialized AI agents
* Produce structured, traceable risk reports

The overall objective and workflow follow the design described in the project document:
“ClauseAI is an AI-powered system designed to automate the process of contract analysis, leveraging a multi-agent framework where each AI agent specializes in a distinct domain such as compliance, finance, and operations to deliver comprehensive insights.”

##  Project Objectives

* Automate extraction of key contract clauses
* Perform semantic search using Pinecone vector database
* Implement RAG-based retrieval for relevant context
* Build domain-specific AI agents:

  * Legal Risk Agent
  * Compliance Risk Agent
  * Finance Risk Agent
  * Operations Risk Agent
* Assess contract risk levels (Low / Medium / High)
* Generate traceable and reproducible JSON reports
