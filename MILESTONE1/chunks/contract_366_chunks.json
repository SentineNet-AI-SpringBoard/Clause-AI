Business model- What sets our platform apart from other platforms in this untapped casual industry is that we have winners win significant amounts of money via time breakers, timing of inputting answers etc. Competitor platforms pay out an average of a few dollars. Our winners are more top loaded and pay out around $2,500 per the top 5 and $1,000 per the top 10. Initially monetization is based upon sponsors paying out the pots. IE, a pot for a single game will be around $25,000 to the winners and Sponsors will pay around $30,000 to $35,000 to sponsor the event. In return they will get around 30,000-75,000 unique user hits and eyeballs to their product/company."
